## Data 

The evaluation uses pre-extracted feature files provided in spreadsheet format (`.xlsx`).

These feature files were obtained by parsing PCAP datasets originating from:
- A SASMaker-generated dataset
- A reference dataset from Biswas et al. (see full reference in `denial_of_service_reference/README.md`)

PCAP files are included for transparency but are not consumed by the evaluation scripts.
